# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#### The plan. 
For the first little bit, I'm going to go through some existing code for a project and pull it in here. My goals for this challenge are:
1. Complete a full-stack web app.
  - Backend: Node/Express
  - Database: MariaDB
  - Frontend: React, using a material framework
2. Containerize the app.
3. Create unit tests as I progress.
4. Create automated integration tests.
5. Create a deployment pipeline that creates a new AWS resource for the container, runs tests, and posts the results *somewhere*. I have yet to figure out where.

### Day 1: January 3, 2019

Today I got a new virgin Debian VM set up to work from. Since my coding adventure includes DevOps elements, I feel that enviroment setup is appropriate use of my time.
